# flask-minimal-testing-issue
Minimal flask app and some tests and some stuff. Trying to figure out why I can't connect to a flask application/server started within/by tests via `python setup.py test` when the darned thing works when I just execute it directly via `python`.

Should probably faithfully recreate the original scenario. Hrrrmmm.
